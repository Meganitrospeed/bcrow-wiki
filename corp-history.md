# Foundation and Growth
The corporation known as The Black Crow Bandits was first registered in YC 118.09.04 in the Caldari State system of Korama, Lonetrek region. Within the first 48 hours the corporation grew to 15 active members , by the end of the week the corp had reached 23 active members. The Black Crow Bandits initially began as a corporation dedicated to the extortion of  Industrial corporations based in High Security Space to make a name for ourselves. Within the week the first corporation Killmail appeared, and was an orca and pod worth approximately 1.2 billion ISK at the time. In addition Black Crow Bandits managed to extort 200 million ISK as part  to send a message to the remaining High Security Industrial corporations that BCROWs meant business https://zkillboard.com/kill/56013030/. Many people now will say, “Who cares, it was an Orca?” However what should be rememberd is that this was an Orca kill by a corp less than 2 weeks old with less than 20 active members.
It was also during this time that offers from Null Sec entities began coming in to the Black Crow Bandits given the potential we had shown. Ultimately BCROWs would accept the invitation from a nearby alliance named Sarcos Federation a member of the Querious Fight Club and an Alliance whose style and goals seemed to mirror our own.
