# Birth of Stefan Nukem
   Stefan Nukem was born in YC 115 and spent many years flying across the face of New Eden. Having flown in nearly all areas of space barring living in the isolation of Wormhole space Nukem eventually went on a hiatus until he could return to something that intrigued, challanged, and proved truly enjoyable to him. In YC 118 Rush Crosix, friend of Nukem both in and out of game presented a new challenge, a corporation built from the ground up that taught new players how to fly, fight, and win in the cluster of New Eden. For the past year Nukem has spent his time on and off with The Black Crow Bandits, leading us in PVP, both as veterans and as newbros.
# Roles
Stephen Nukem has always desired one thing above all others, fighting against other capsuleers. To help achieve Rush's vision of a corporation wholly dedicated to capsuleer versus capsuleer combat Nukem has spent much of his time helping to train newbros, guide corp fleet commanders, and making sure that when the alarms go off that The Black Crow Bandits are a name to be known and feared across New Eden. The results of this dedication and vision have been decisive. Capsuleer skill both in skill points and actual piloting skill have grown exponentially in the past year from averating 300-500 kills a month to a new average of ~2000 kills a month. From being one of the smallest numbers of deployed pilots to ranking top in alliance participation of CTAs and other alliance and coalition fleets. 
# Experiences
In addition to his pride in the progress that the line members of The Black Crow Bandits have made Stefan Nukem has taken pleasure in many individual events with the corp, both on deployment and at home.

* In Immensea The Black Crow Bandits banded together in a way that we hadn't before
* We helped to band the coalition together in particular to kill Defiant Daniel as he kept coming through our space
* Managed to single-handedly boosh a goon fleet to its destruction

Nukem has also noted that the current direction of The Black Crow Bandits is something to be proud of as members. It is bittersweet that we are no longer able to field our entire corp on the field at a single time due to our growth in numbers and time zones but this is a very positive direction for the corp.
