<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Yves The Nephew -->

# History of Yves the Nephew
  Yves the Nephew first began playing eve in YC 106 flying solo. Taking a direction of industry he shortly learned how much more effective it was to mine in larger groups. For a long time he stuck to high sec space mining. Due to issues with real life however Yves was forced to take a break from it. 
	In YC 118 Yves returned from his hiatus and joined Strontium Califate in Querious region. Most of his time was spent running anomolies and running to W-IX to buy stuff when it was under the control of Sarcos Federation. Eventually a member of The Black Crow Bandits named Xena Stargood began talking with Yves. Eventually Rush Crosix reached out and spoke with Yves fairly often. Yves found himself leaning toward coming to The Black Crow Bandits and was finally pushed into it when his alliance was set to neutral by Sarcos and The Black Crow Bandits had decided to leave Querious. 
	In the time since joining Yves has made it his goal to grow the EU presence of BCROW, and to reach his personal goal of making 100billion ISK.
# Roles
Since joining The Black Crow Bandits Yves has been granted the title of Director of EU Operations.
# Experiences
Among his many experiences in the corp a few points have stood out to Yves:
* Being able to fly as a scout in an interceptor has been the most fun thing in PVP that Yves has found
* The corp does not care how space rich or poor you are, if you are flying with us, if you are doing your best to help, then the corp will go out of its way to take care you of you and back you when you need it most.
# Special Shoutout
A special shoutout that Yves has wanted to make perfectly clear goes to Foob and Rush. Of the leadership Yves has found these two to be the top dogs, knowledgable, and invested in the corp. In particular Foob deserves a special mention for his demenor, and his willingness to stand up to anyone including leadership when he needs to. All the guys in corp are great but these are the two that Yves has special recognition for.
