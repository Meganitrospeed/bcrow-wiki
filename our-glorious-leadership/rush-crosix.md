# The Origins of Rush Crosix
To the scholarly and curious researchers the EVE Gate is a point of great interest. Located in the New Eden system of the Genesis region of the New Eden cluster this great wormhole is the legendary source of life for all beings of New Eden. One entity that is often overlooked is that of Rush Crosix. When the EVE Gate collapsed cutting off our connection to the Milky Way galaxy humanity panicked and mourned the loss of the connection to our homeworld. Unnoticed by the masses, the collapse of the EVE Gate left a field of debris expanding forever outward. Within a capsule sized piece of this debris a new consciousness was born. Some would call this the birth of a god, others would call this a strange anomoly of the universe. We call this entity, named god by the Amarr, Rush Crosix. As the ages past civilzations rose and fell, the Talocan, the Jove, all these races grew, explored, fought, and died, beneath the cold assesing gaze of the unborn deity of life and death, but it was not yet time for him to take corporeal form. As the four modern civilizations of New Eden grew, Rush saw in them the potential of blood and violence that the early races lacked. In YC 11x a cruel and capricious god emerged from its cocoon of debris after ages adrift through the cosmos, Rush Crosix was born a capsuleer his reign of tyranny and destruction has finally begun.
