# The Origins of Rush Crosix
Tens of thousands of years ago a wormhole in the New Eden system of the Genesis region of the New Eden cluster collapsed. This event was the start of life anew in the New Eden cluster. While most know that this event shaped the history of life in New Eden another side effect is the birth of an entity that has until now been overlooked. Unnoticed by the masses, a capsule sized piece of this debris a new consciousness was born. Some would call this entity a demon, or some sort of f#@ked up god, both of these descriptors however are apt. We now call this entity Rush Crosix. As the ages past civilzations rose and fell, the Talocan, the Jove, all these races grew, explored, fought, and died, beneath the cold assesing gaze of the unborn demon of death and wanton destruction, but it was not yet time for him to take corporeal form. As the four modern civilizations of New Eden grew, Rush saw in them the potential of blood and violence that the early races lacked. In YC 11x a cruel and capricious god emerged from its cocoon of debris after ages adrift through the cosmos, Rush Crosix was born a capsuleer his reign of tyranny and destruction has finally begun.
